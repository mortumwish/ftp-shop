                    <span><p>Formerly a counter culture in fashion that relished in existing as an outlier of the fashion
                    spectrum, streetwear today is ironically mainstream and more “safe” than it ever was. Now, amidst an
                    exponentially evolving landscape infiltrated by multi-million dollar investments, streetwear has
                    decidedly lost most of its edge.</p> <br>
                        <p>Taking up the mantle as the next iteration on streetwear’s “against the grain” roots, Los Angeles
                    native Zac Clark’s Fuckthepopulation (FTP) is blazing a trail back to streetwear’s early heyday,
                    unafraid and indifferent to who he pisses off along the way. “Just do whatever you want,” said Clark
                    in his 2015 No Jumper interview. “I make whatever the fuck I want to make, I don’t care who’s
                    feelings might get hurt tomorrow or the next day. I’ll make whatever or say whatever the fuck I
                    want.”  </p><br>
                        <p>It’s interesting to see how Clark’s FTP has managed to blend the controversial roots of brands like
                    Fuct with the mainstream appeal of California streetwear labels like Huf and Undefeated, becoming a
                    modern streetwear success story (without losing any of its edge).</p>

                <div class="body-text">
                    <p>Established in 2010 by a highschool-aged Clark, FTP, then .KcufThepopulation, served as a
                        template for the force it would become. .Kcuf’s early work featured inverted American flags with
                        bold political statements, early cues into FTP’s essence. It was Clark’s ethos for the brand
                        however, that drew the attention of classmates and became the backbone for the label’s now
                        ravenous cult following. “Just all the negatives in the world,” explained Clark in one of his
                        first interviews with blog, <i>Lords of the Pyramids.</i> “I just never went along with society
                        so I decided I wanted to share that mentality by starting a clothing line that had a message.”
                    </p><br>
                    <p>As a teen at the height of a unique transitional moment in music and streetwear in the early
                        2010s, Clark was sitting front row to the rebellious spirit transforming culture. While the Odd
                        Future collective and Kid Cudi were breaking the mold of mainstream rap, labels like Fuct,
                        Freshjive, 10.Deep, Huf, and Supreme were introducing (or in some cases, continuing a pattern
                        of) subversion and anarchist attitudes in a streetwear context. Clark, and subsequently FTP,
                        were a product of Clark’s influences that he made into his own. Like many other streetwear
                        brands before and since, pushing the envelope was the motive, T-shirts and hoodies just happened
                        to be the medium.</p>

                <div class="body-text">
                    <p>As the prodigal son of a fleeting era of streetwear, there’s an immense amount of pressure to
                        keep the spirit of defiance and challenge to society's accepted worldview that now lies with
                        Clark and his contemporaries. FTP is moving into its 10th year on the scene, and the now 25 year
                        old Clark must grapple with the labelsБЛЯТЬ success while keeping his trademark anonymous persona and
                        the brand’s expectations in check. Unpredictable as the future of streetwear may be, there is
                        one sure thing; Clark will always be about his vision, his brand and his people and nobody can
                        get in his or FTP’s way. “That’s what I’m always going to be about,” Clark told <i>The Fader</i>.
                        “Just making the shit that I want, and selling it to people who actually fuck with it.”</p>
